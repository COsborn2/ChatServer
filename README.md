Server-Client transaction\
\
After accept(), the server sends “ok” (2 bytes) to the client. The client upon receipt of “ok” sends the client's user name in 8 bytes. Server sends “ok” (2 bytes) to the client, signaling the client is entered in the client list and ready for the chat session.\
\
Chat session\ 
Server:\
\
For a character string received not beginning with '/', it is within-room broadcast. Else it is a command.\
\
case command\
“/r” //Send room names, "Hobby 330" (if the server has Hobby and 330 rooms)\
“/j roomname” //Send "ok", so the client knows the user is in the "roomname"\
“/l” //Send the names of the users in the current room\
“/x” //Close the connection and log off the server\
“/p name” //Send "ok" to let the client know the user is in private chat with name\
“/q” //Send "ok" to let the client know the private chat with name ended\
“/f filename” //Read file name and data from the client and send the file name and data to the designated client in the above file transfer format\
end case;\
\
All strings must be sent with the terminating 0, except sign in session and file command. For example, “/r” must be send as '/', 'r', and 0.
